# Language_Classification_with_Naive_Bayes
 In this project, we build a language classifier that can differentiate between Slovak, Czech, and English languages. 

 We will accomplish it in by completing each of the following task in the project:

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis + Visualization

Task 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Task 3: The Naive Bayes Model

Task 4: Simple Adjustments to the Naive Bayes Model

Task 5: Using Advanced Techniques to Improve Performance
