# Language_Classification_with_Naive_Bayes
 In this project, we build a language classifier that can differentiate between Slovak, Czech, and English languages. 

 We will accomplish it in by completing each of the following task in the project:

Introduction: A brief explanation of the topic and goals we hope to achieve, as well as a demo of the final model we design.

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis + Visualization

Task 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Task 3: The Naive Bayes Model

Task 4: Simple Adjustments to the Naive Bayes Model

Task 5: Using Advanced Techniques to Improve Performance

While you are watching me work on each step, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed. This will allow you to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks. After all, we learn best with active, hands-on learning
